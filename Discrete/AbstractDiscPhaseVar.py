AbstractDiscPhaseVar.py

Abstract class for discrete Phase-Type distributions.

Migration of jphase.AbstractDiscPhaseVar from Java to Python.

Theory
------
A DPH(alpha, A) is the number of steps until absorption of a discrete-time
Markov chain with n transient phases and one absorbing phase, with transition
matrix and initial distribution

    P = [ A   a ]      a = 1 - A 1         (``get_mat0``)
        [ 0   1 ]      alpha_0 = 1 - alpha 1   (``get_vec0``)

The representation is valid when alpha >= 0, alpha 1 <= 1, A >= 0, A 1 <= 1
and sp(A) < 1. The last condition is what makes every phase transient and
I - A invertible.

    pmf                P(X = 0) = alpha_0,   P(X = k) = alpha A^{k-1} a,  k >= 1
    cdf                F(k) = 1 - alpha A^k 1
    factorial moments  E[X(X-1)...(X-k+1)] = k! alpha (I-A)^{-k} A^{k-1} 1
    mean               E[X] = alpha (I-A)^{-1} 1

The closure operations (sum, mixture, minimum, maximum, and geometric and
PH-distributed random sums) are documented method by method.

        Geometric(0.5) that happens for p = 0.9, 0.95 and 0.99, where the
        correct answers are 4, 5 and 7.

        Sum of a Phase-type-distributed number of iid copies of this
        variable.

        Java: ``sumPH(DiscPhaseVar B)``.

        ``counter`` is itself a DPH variable (beta, S) whose VALUE is the
        number of copies of ``this`` to add: Y = X_1 + ... + X_N, with the
        X_i iid copies of this variable and N ~ counter. This generalizes
        ``sum_geom``, which is the special case where ``counter`` is a
        1-phase geometric count.

        Construction (n1 = self.n_phases, n2 = counter.n_phases; a0 = P(self
        = 0); a = self's absorption vector ``get_mat0()``; beta, S =
        counter's vector/matrix):

            M         = (I_n2 - a0*S)^{-1}
            alpha_res = alpha (x) (M^T beta)
            A_res     = (A (x) I_n2) + (a (x) alpha) (x) (M S)

        The state is (phase of the current copy, phase of the counter). While
        a copy runs, only its phase moves (A (x) I). When it absorbs (a), the
        counter takes one step (S). The next copy either starts in a phase
        (alpha) or is 0 (a0); a 0 copy makes the counter step again at once.
        M = sum_{m>=0} (a0 S)^m collects those chains of zero-length copies,
        both at the start (alpha_res) and after each absorption (M S = S M).

        Divergences from Java
        ---------------------
        1. Java computes ``M`` with
           ``ISInv.solve(Matrices.identity(this.getNumPhases()), ...)``. It
           solves against ``I_n1`` even though ``ISInv`` is n2 x n2, so the
           call only works when n1 == n2 and raises an exception otherwise.
           The continuous version, ``AbstractContPhaseVar.sumPH``, uses
           ``Matrices.identity(n2)``, as it should. That is what is done here.
        2. Java multiplies the second term by (1 - a0). The formula above
           has no such factor: Java's would be correct if ``alpha`` were the
           conditional vector alpha / (1 - a0) (the start of a copy GIVEN that
           it is not 0), but ``getVector()`` is the unconditional alpha, so
           the factor counts (1 - a0) twice. With a0 = 0 the two versions
           coincide. With a0 > 0, Java's version loses probability mass:
           example, alpha = [0.5, 0.2] (a0 = 0.3) against a 2-phase counter
           differs from the brute-force compound sum by 0.016 in the pmf.
           The continuous ``sumPH`` has the same factor.

        No discrete test exists on the Java side, so neither problem ever
        showed up there.

        Sanity check
        ------------
        If ``counter`` is the degenerate DPH equal to 1 with probability 1
        (n2 = 1, beta = [1], S = [[0]]), summing "1 copy of self" must give
        back self: S = [[0]] makes M = [[1]] and the second term vanish,
        leaving alpha_res = alpha and A_res = A (up to the harmless (x) I_1
        relabeling of the phases).

          - the last n2 phases track ``other`` alone, once ``self`` has

        The combined process only absorbs once BOTH have absorbed, which is
        "the last one to finish".

        Divergence from Java
        --------------------
        Java's discrete ``max`` is a line-for-line copy of
        ``AbstractContPhaseVar.max``, including the joint "both still
        running" block, built with ``kroneckerSum(A, B) = A(x)I + I(x)B``,
        and the two boundary-crossing blocks, built with
        ``kronecker(I_n1, mat0(B))`` / ``kronecker(mat0(A), I_n2)``.

        That is the right construction in CONTINUOUS time: with probability
        one, at most one of the two subprocesses moves at any given instant,
        so rates simply add (hence the Kronecker SUM) and, when one
        subprocess crosses into absorption, the other's phase is unchanged
        during that same instantaneous event (hence the IDENTITY next to
        each ``mat0``).

        In DISCRETE time neither assumption holds: every phase transition
        step advances both subprocesses simultaneously, and both may even
        absorb in the very same step. Reusing the continuous formula
        produces invalid rows (row sums greater than 1) as soon as both
        variables have a positive chance of continuing - confirmed
        numerically for two Geometric(0.5)/Geometric(0.7) variables, where
        the joint self-loop alone came out to 0.8 while transitions to the
        two boundary blocks added another 0.7 + 0.5, all from the same
        state. The correct discrete-time construction replaces the
        Kronecker sum with the Kronecker PRODUCT for the joint block (as
        Java's own discrete ``min`` already correctly does, unlike ``max``),
        and replaces each boundary identity with the surviving variable's
        own sub-stochastic matrix, since it also takes a real transition in
        the step where the other one absorbs:

            joint block    = A (x) B                  (was A(+)B)
            self-only edge = A (x) mat0(other)         (was I_n1 (x) mat0(other))
            other-only edge= mat0(self) (x) B          (was mat0(self) (x) I_n2)

        With this fix the row sums work out to
        ``1 - mat0(self)_i * mat0(other)_j`` for every joint row - i.e. the
        only probability mass missing from a joint row is exactly the
        probability that both variables absorb in that same step, which is
        precisely when ``max`` itself absorbs. No test exercises this
        method on the Java side either, so the bug is latent there too.
