DenseDiscPhaseVar.py

Discrete Phase-Type distribution with a dense matrix representation.

Migration of ``jphase.DenseDiscPhaseVar`` (Java) to Python.

Every numerical method (pmf, cdf, moments, quantiles) lives in
``AbstractDiscretePhaseType``. This class only supplies the two operations that
depend on how the matrix is stored: ``copy`` and ``new_var``. That is the same
split Java draws between ``AbstractDiscPhaseVar`` and ``DenseDiscPhaseVar``.

class DenseDiscretePhaseType(AbstractDiscretePhaseType):

    DPH(alpha, A) with A stored as a dense ``np.ndarray``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : array_like
        1-D vector of initial probabilities over the transient phases. It must
        satisfy alpha >= 0 and sum(alpha) <= 1.
    A : array_like
        Sub-stochastic n x n matrix. It must satisfy A >= 0, row sums <= 1 and
        sp(A) < 1.

    Examples
    --------
    Geometric with success probability 0.5, supported on {1, 2, 3, ...}:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> X = DenseDiscretePhaseType(np.array([1.0]), np.array([[0.5]]))
    >>> round(X.mean(), 6), round(X.var(), 6)
    (2.0, 2.0)
    >>> [round(X.pmf(k), 4) for k in range(4)]
    [0.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125]

    Negative binomial as two phases in series:

    >>> alpha = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    >>> A = np.array([[0.6, 0.4], [0.0, 0.6]])
    >>> Y = DenseDiscretePhaseType(alpha, A)
    >>> round(Y.mean(), 6), round(Y.var(), 6)
    (5.0, 7.5)

    def copy(self) -> "DenseDiscretePhaseType":
        """
        Independent copy of this variable. Java: ``copy()``.

        The arrays are duplicated, so mutating the copy does not affect the
        original.

        return DenseDiscretePhaseType(self._alpha.copy(), self._A.copy())

    def new_var(self, n: int) -> "DenseDiscretePhaseType":
        """
        Empty variable of the same type with `n` phases. Java: ``newVar(int n)``.

        It returns alpha and A filled with zeros, which is a valid if degenerate
        DPH: with alpha = 0 we get alpha_0 = 1, that is P(X = 0) = 1.

        The closure operations (sum, mixture, minimum, maximum) use it to create
        the container for the result without knowing the concrete subclass, and
        then fill it with the corresponding blocks.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If n < 1.
